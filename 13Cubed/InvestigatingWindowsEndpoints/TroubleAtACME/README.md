# Trouble at ACME

This challenge is comprised of two (2) disk and two (2) memory images

## Analysis Goals

* Determine if a full domain compromise has occurred as a result of this lateral movement, and if any successful exfiltration has occurred
* Identify any additional IOCs and compromised identities
* Identify any evidence of installed persistence mechanisms

## Context

I have not reviewed the `trouble_at_acme.pdf` file prior to conducting this analysis beyond the STOP HERE page where the answers lie beyond.
